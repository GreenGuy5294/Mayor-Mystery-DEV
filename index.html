\(set:$trainDialogue to (a:&quot;Jed wondered if Burgerocity was selling the Big Boy today. The Big Boy is a special burger that the owner only sells on random days. On one hand, today is Burgerocity&#39;s last day, so it would be a missed opportunity if the owner didn&#39;t sell it. On the other hand, it had only been a few days since it was last sold, and it takes lots of material to make, so he probably does not have enough.&quot;,&quot;Jed looked out the train window for some birds. Jed had made it a habit to birdwatch while on the train. Strangely enough, Jed didn&#39;t see any during his ride. The weather&#39;s normal today, where are all the birds? Did someone scare them all away? Or some//thing//?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the events happening today. His favorite burger place being shut down, the letter he received in the mail, and the quest given to him. Jed loves to help people and wanted to succeed in this regard, but the things happening today seem a bit much. Was this quest expected of him? What would happen if he never met up with the writer of the letter? When is it okay to let things take their own course?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Rafael. He and Jed met when he first moved in the apartment complex, and they got along quite well. They have quite a few things in common and have hung out a few times. However, their schedules rarely line up, so they don&#39;t talk to each other as much as they would like.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Ted. Ted is much older than Jed, and Ted had been living in the apartment complex way before Jed moved in. Despite the fact that they&#39;ve been neighbors for a while, they have barely gotten to know each other. Ted has almost completely forgotten who Jed is, despite his numerous attempts to introduce himself. Maybe one day they shall become friends...&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Josefine. Jed and Josefine have known each other for years, but only just recently did Josefine move near Jed. She had been living with her parents for a few years but eventually wanted her own place. Jed convinced her to move in near him, and she did. She&#39;s not new to Webster Groves, however, since she used to &quot; + (cond:$josefineStore is &#39;unknown&#39;,&#39;have a job&#39;,&#39;own a business&#39;) + &quot; here.&quot;,&quot;Jed wondered if he could ever get a job at Bosco&#39;s Family Food Store, the supermarket next to his apartment complex. On one hand, it wouldn&#39;t be that hard of a job, he&#39;d get to talk to people a lot, and it&#39;s a very short walk from his place to the store. However, the store&#39;s current owner, John Bosco, has developed a slight distaste for Jed. As far as Jed knows, he hasn&#39;t done anything that would warrant this kind of disdain (a disdain that he&#39;s not even aware of), but the owner simply doesn&#39;t like his over-the-top personality.&quot;,&quot;Jed realized he has never been inside the Webster Groves City Hall&quot; + (cond:$visitsCityHall &gt; 0,&#39; before today&#39;,&#39;&#39;) + &quot;. The building is of course open to the public, but he had simply never thought to enter it, nor had a reason to enter it. But now with the letter he got this morning talking about evil and distrustful people inside City Hall, I think it&#39;s safe to say Jed (cond:$visitsCityHall &gt; 0,&#39;had&#39;,&#39;has&#39;) a pretty good reason for visiting. Its interior has popped up in some conversations with friends: its gigantic size, the beautiful columns, the art on the roof, and the large maze-like structure of its hallways. Would it be wrong to ask for some kind of tour?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the computer lab inside the town library. The computers have been out of order for quite a while. Despite this, sometimes when Jed enters the computer lab, he can see stuff on one of the screens, but it&#39;s usually something frozen. Do the computers actually work, and someone&#39;s just been freezing them on command and lying they&#39;re out of order? Or are they so broken that they just show random things whenever they feel like it?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the criminal gang in West Side that he keeps hearing about. They&#39;re mostly known for mugging people that are unfortunate enough to cross paths with them. He then began to wonder how much being a mugger pays. You could get lucky and get someone who carries lots of money, but recently there are fewer and fewer people who ever carry cash at all. Imagine being a mugger for a living, but constantly mugging people who don&#39;t carry cash! The mugging economy must be going downhill compared to the past.&quot;,&quot;Jed looked around the train car he was in. &quot; + (cond:$wearing is &#39;3d glasses&#39;,&#39;It looked absolutely incredible in 3D.&#39;,&#39;For some reason, it looked nicer than the other ones he\&#39;s been in before.&#39;) + &quot; The seats were pretty, and also very comfy. There were also tables in between the seats, something Jed knows that only a few of the train cars have. Along with the great landscape view that can be seen through the big glass windows, this ride was very enjoyable.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the Gadget Factorie, the electronic store near his apartment. Even if Jed was somehow able to purchase appliances from there, almost everything was self-assembly, and Jed has absolutely no experience in assembling appliances. Self-assembly furniture makes sense, but appliances? No. The only things pre-built are the small items, such as the VR headset and the toaster.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the aptly named Town Square Hardware Store. All the times Jed has been in Town Square, he&#39;s seen the store&#39;s owner in the shop. Surely he has to do something else in his day-to-day life, right? Perhaps he truly loves the hardware store, so much so that it has completely thrown off his work-life balance. But even so, there has to be //something// that this guy does when he&#39;s not working. Some kind of meet-up group? A nice hobby? Something else?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the Impulse Arcade, the arcade in Town Square. They only have a small handful of games, none of which were any big-name arcade games. Nonetheless, Jed would go there all the time as a kid. He was only ever able to scrounge up change for a few tokens, so he&#39;d never be able to get some of the really big prizes. If you&#39;re able to get enough tickets, you can get some pretty cool stuff that you can&#39;t really get anywhere else.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the barber shop in West Side. Jed goes there about once every two weeks, to make sure his hair has a nice, clean shape to it. He&#39;s been getting the same haircut for years. But, you know what they say: if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it! Why take a risk trying a new style when you can just stick with what you got?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about Tactical Bold, the clothing store in West Side. Jed was never really big into style or fashion. The boldest piece of clothing he owns is a hat that was passed down to him by a friend, (cond:(history:) contains any of (a:&#39;Mirror&#39;,&#39;Throw Away Hat&#39;),&#39;but apparently he hates it or something.&#39;,&#39;but he never really wears it.&#39;) Maybe one day Jed will wear something that will truly catch the eye of people in public in a captivating and innovative way, but until then he can just wear the random stuff in his closet.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about Gasology, the gas station in West Side. Jed had only been in there a few times, just when he needs something quick and he&#39;s in the area. He&#39;s known the current owner for quite some time, but she only just recently took over the business. One thing that Jed has never interacted with(cond:$lottoSpendings &gt; 0,&#39; before today&#39;,&#39;&#39;) in the gas station is the ticket machine. If you think about it, lottery wouldn&#39;t even exist if there was no way to be able to profit off of it.&quot;))

He also has a sort of... weird... aura around him. Like he doesn&#39;t belong? Not in a social sense but in some other kind of way...

If the buttons are causing the weird happenings, then why do they sometimes happen when Jed doesn&#39;t press a button?&quot;))]

\The secretary hands you two name tags: one has a fake name and fake plumbing business, and one labels you as a City Hall visitor. The secretary then gets up from her desk and gestures for you to follow her. You go through the two large double doors on the right side of the room.

The doors lead into a long hallway with an elevator at the end. Throughout the hallway, there are about 5-6 security guards walking around. You start to feel a little uneasy, but you follow the secretary nonetheless.

The two of you arrive at the elevator, and two security guards are standing beside it - one on each side. The guards look at you while you enter the elevator, but they don&#39;t say anything. The elevator doors close and you can feel a slight sense of relief. The secretary presses a button and the elevator starts to go downwards.

&quot;That was the easy part,&quot; the secretary explains. &quot;Once we get downstairs, there&#39;s a door tucked away behind the elevator. That&#39;s where we need to go.&quot;

After what feels like an eternity, you hear a loud booming sound while you were asleep. You instantly wake up to find the walls of the police station destroyed. Was this freedom? A chance to go out into the world and get some food?

\The mayor is sitting inside the room already waiting for you. &quot;Hello, Jed.&quot;

You turn around and security has already grabbed the secretary and pulled her away. The door then shuts, leaving you, the mayor, and a couple of security guards alone in the room.

On the back wall of the room is a giant TV screen with a big panel underneath it. You can&#39;t make out what most of it says, but you can clearly see a map of Webster Groves with a dot over Burgerocity.

&quot;So,&quot; the mayor says, &quot;you heard about my little shutdown. You&#39;re upset that your favorite burger place is shutting down. I get that.&quot; He starts to walk towards you. &quot;But let me explain why. I met up with some people last night, Jed. People not of this earth. And they are going to give me great power. I just have to do a little something for them in return.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you interrogate.

&quot;They told me that long long ago, they left something behind, something very important to them. It got left right under that nasty burger shop over in West Side.&quot;

&quot;You take that back!&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately for you, I&#39;m not going to. They&#39;re going to tear that place down and dig. And keep on digging until they find what I need. And then... I&#39;ll be a god on Earth. And as for you, well, you&#39;ve got two options here. Option number 1: I arrest you for fraud and trespassing. Option number 2: you join me, helping me get what we need, and then we can share the power.&quot; 

The mayor turns around and looks at the TV, down at the panel, then back to you. &quot;So, which is it? I assume this won&#39;t be a hard decision.&quot;

[[&quot;Go ahead and arrest me.&quot;-&gt;Arrest]]

Jed, you do realize you actually had a third option, right? You saw that, didn&#39;t you? It was the bottom option on the page. Maybe you didn&#39;t scroll down far enough? I&#39;m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here. I just, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d select this option.

&quot;Very well then,&quot; the mayor continues, &quot;I won&#39;t try to push you. More power for me! //Guards!//&quot;

The two guards grab you by your arms and drag you out of the room.

\Jed... what have you done? 

&quot;I knew you&#39;d come to your senses, Jed,&quot; the mayor says. &quot;Together we are going to rule this earth.&quot;

The mayor escorts you out of the room, where you walk by the secretary, who is being handcuffed by security guards. She looks at you confused as if she doesn&#39;t believe the scenario she is watching unfold.

The next day, Burgerocity is shut down. A company arrives to demolish it, and by nightfall, the digging begins. It takes about 5 days total until they find a strange, red, glowing capsule. They bring it in to you, collect their payment from the mayor, and then leave City Hall.

You and the mayor then go back downstairs to the communications room. The mayor presses some buttons on the panel, and suddenly a distorted voice begins speaking. (text-style: &quot;fidget&quot;)[&quot;Have you found it yet?&quot;]

&quot;Yes, we found it this morning,&quot; the mayor replies. &quot;How do we get it to you?&quot;

A hatch opens up on the far-right side of the panel. (text-style: &quot;fidget&quot;)[&quot;Please slide it in there.&quot;]

The mayor puts the capsule into the hole, which then closes. &quot;So now what?&quot; he asks. &quot;What do we get?&quot;

(text-style: &quot;fidget&quot;)[&quot;You get to live.&quot;]

You then hear a giant booming sound coming from the surface. You and the mayor rush upstairs. The sky is a dark shade of red, and you can see what you believe to be alien ships up in the sky. Buildings are being demolished, set on fire, exploded, and destroyed. Many are running out into the streets in fear. People run up to you for help. &quot;Mayor Dixon, what do we do?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know.&quot;

There you go, Jed. Was that worth it?

The mayor runs after you, but when he gets to the elevator doorway you kick him back as the doors shut. You then ride the elevator up and exit City Hall as fast as you can.]]

\When you exit City Hall, you notice a large gathering of people outside in the walkway. A commotion has begun due to the large amount of smoke pouring from the building.

&quot;Is everything okay, Jed?&quot; a spectator asks you.

You look at the secretary. &quot;The mayor is the reason why Burgerocity shut down,&quot; she yells. &quot;He&#39;s working with an independent business from outside of town and taking property away just for them. They bribed him, and he accepted their bribe.&quot;

The crowd gasps and then murmurs amongst themselves. In almost perfect timing, the mayor runs out of the building. The crowd stares at him. &quot;That&#39;s... not true...&quot; he huffs.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; a voice barks from the crowd. She steps forward. It&#39;s none other than Chairwoman Sandra Clifton of the County Board of Commissions! &quot;Well then, what happened, Mayor Dixon? Why is Burgerocity being shut down? And why are there construction plans beginning tonight?&quot;

(if:$FUN is 11 or $theGame)[&quot;I- uh... well there&#39;s uh-&quot; the mayor stammers, &quot;the place failed a uh... it failed the... game! It failed the game! YOU LOST THE GAME!!&quot;

The crowd goes completely silent. Someone begins screaming. &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! I LOST MY STREAK!&quot;

Suddenly, everyone starts shouting in anger. How could the mayor have done this? What could have caused the mayor to resort to such cruelty?

&quot;Glen Dixon,&quot; states Chairwoman Sandra Clifton of the County Board of Commissions, &quot;I will see that your impeachment trial happens soon. And I&#39;m canceling those construction plans of yours.&quot;

The fire department soon arrives, ushering everyone away. As you begin to walk towards the train station, the secretary catches you. &quot;Thank you so much, Jed,&quot; she says. &quot;Not only for trusting me but for diving head first to fix the problem.(if:$visitsSecretary is 1)[ Still strange how you already came to my desk in uniform, though!] Tomorrow I&#39;ll talk to you about refinancing.

\Jed sat next to the front door of Bosco&#39;s, wondering what to do now. While Jed does understand that what he did was deserving of a ban, he also felt that he never would have done those things if he didn&#39;t find out what John Bosco truly felt about him. So there he sat next to the door, almost as if he was protesting his ban.

He sat there all day. As the store closed, John walked past him and paid no attention.

He sat there overnight, where the opening manager of the store saw him but also paid no attention (more so because she was confused rather than disliking Jed). He sat there the rest of the day, where John passed him twice: when he came into work and when he closed the store.

This pattern happened for days. Jed simply refused to go to another store for his groceries. He just could never believe what happened between him and John. He thought they were friends; they talked every time he came to the store, John always seemed interested in what he had to say, and always let Jed speak as long as he wanted, with minimal interruption. 

But of course, you can&#39;t sit in one place for long before your basic human needs need to be fulfilled. And since Jed refused to go anywhere else, it was only a matter of time before he died.

\If you&#39;re reading this book, then that means that you think the world is about to end, or the world is literally about to end. But don&#39;t worry. This book will guide you through the three simple steps to help you prepare for the end.

&#39;&#39;Step 1) Talk to people.&#39;&#39; No one wants to go alone. The want to talk to people before the world ends is going to be shared by everyone. In chapter 1, I will describe who is best to talk to, and also show you a list of predetermined end-of-world phrases such as &quot;How are you coping?&quot; or &quot;So... are you gonna pay me back that $5 now?&quot;

&#39;&#39;Step 2) Do something.&#39;&#39; Whether this means crossing something off your bucket list or trying to stop impending doom, you&#39;re not gonna get the most out of life by simply sitting down on your couch. In chapter 2, I discuss the perfect activities to do before the world ends.

&#39;&#39;Step 3) Invest all of your money into cryptocurrency.&#39;&#39; If the world is ending, so is your money. And if you&#39;re not going to spend it, don&#39;t let it go to waste! In chapter 3, I will give the pros and cons of investing in different &quot;cryptos,&quot; and also show you my very own cryptocurrency that has no flaws whatsoever.]

\###COLD WAS THE NIGHT. I WAS STABBED.
&quot;Wait; If you got stabbed, how are you alive writing this story?&quot; you may ask. Well, let me tell you a story called &quot;I survived.&quot; 

It begins with me sitting on my couch, like any couch potato. However, I was no ordinary potato on a couch. You may not have noticed, but this couch was actually a recliner couch. Once again, this is no ordinary couch; it is a magic couch!

&quot;But how is it magic?&quot; you whine. Say that again and I will turn you into a couch. Yep; I have a couch that can turn you into a couch because science magic is really cool and does stuff!

Now, back to me getting stabbed. Spoiler: it was a magic recliner couch that stabbed me to death.

&quot;TO DEATH?&quot;, you yell loudly, &quot;BUT YOU SAID YOU SURVIVED!&quot; Yep, I survived, and I am telling you this story, so stop interrupting me!

Anyway, it begins with me sitting on my couch, like any couch potato. This was right before my epic adventure started. The magic recliner couch slowly reached over for a knife; I could see it, but I said nothing about it. As it swung the knife at me, I ducked because I had just dropped my piece of chocolate cake onto the floor.

I looked up, noticing I dodged a knife, and I said, &quot;Hey. That&#39;s pretty good. However, don&#39;t stab me, couch, I have a book to write later about this situation.&quot;]

No one&#39;s bought anything. No one even came into the store. And it&#39;s not like you didn&#39;t advertise it! You told many people about it: your neighbors, random people in the supermarket, random people on the train, random people that happened to walk by your shop, and more.

Was Jed&#39;s Jams never meant to be? Was it too good to be true? Or did Jed care about this idea so much that he never realized it was something no one wanted?

The incoming bills began to scare you. In about 25 days you&#39;d have to pay them all. What revenue would you pay them with? You walked out of the store and looked at the front, wondering where you went wrong.

And that&#39;s when the sky went red and the entire store exploded.

\Starch and Crinkle, equally known as Arruga y Chuño, are not exactly known for having the craziest adventures. They live within an abandoned room of a 2-star hotel with their cat Porche, and occasionally hang out with their family friend Yeyé in the trailer park.

Of course, not everything can stay the same!

One fateful day following the events of their last adventure, where they needed to find the thief of Crinkle&#39;s meal from BurgerZone™, they decided to go from their home of Santa Teresa, New Mexico to Sunland Park, the bigger city down the road. Except this time, they didn&#39;t need to go while on a hunt!

Since their last adventure, Starch and Crinkle&#39;s friends Salvia and Nabo have since gotten jobs at the local amusement park, Super Amusement Land. With a little coordination beforehand, the two of them set up Starch, Crinkle, and even Yeyé with an all day pass. Did management know about it? No, but that&#39;s okay!

Yeyé only actually participated in two rides - more than expected - but even Crinkle began to tap out after the Super Hanging Upside Down Epic Fear Coaster. Only Chuño remained, ready to brave the final ride: the Hyper Speedy Zoom-Zoom Wowie-Wow-Wow Zoom Fast Machine Super Super Coaster.

&quot;This will be nothing,&quot; he said, well knowing the only way he was allowed to ride was through a combination of 6-inch platform shoes and very tall pants to hide the evidence that he might not reach the height requirement.

Strapping into the seat, the Hyper Speedy Zoom-Zoom Wowie-Wow-Wow Zoom Fast Machine Super Super Coaster blasted off immediately, and a mere 30 seconds later it had already done four laps across the perimeter of Super Amusement Land.

&quot;Yeah, I think I&#39;m done,&quot; Starch uttered, ready to go home.]

\Jed (cond:$INV contains &quot;buster&quot;,&quot;and Buster &quot;,&quot;&quot;)got on the train, and shortly after it began to move. 

During the train ride, (either:&quot;Jed wondered if Burgerocity was selling the Big Boy today. The Big Boy is a special burger that the owner only sells on random days. On one hand, today is Burgerocity&#39;s last day, so it would be a missed opportunity if the owner didn&#39;t sell it. On the other hand, it had only been a few days since it was last sold, and it takes lots of material to make, so he probably does not have enough.&quot;,&quot;Jed looked out the train window for some birds. Jed had made it a habit to birdwatch while on the train. Strangely enough, Jed didn&#39;t see any during his ride. The weather&#39;s normal today, where are all the birds? Did someone scare them all away? Or some//thing//?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the events happening today. His favorite burger place being shut down, the letter he received in the mail, and the quest given to him. Jed loves to help people and wanted to succeed in this regard, but the things happening today seem a bit much. Was this quest expected of him? What would happen if he never met up with the writer of the letter? When is it okay to let things take their own course?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Rafael. He and Jed met when he first moved in the apartment complex, and they got along quite well. They have quite a few things in common and have hung out a few times. However, their schedules rarely line up, so they don&#39;t talk to each other as much as they would like.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Ted. Ted is much older than Jed, and Ted had been living in the apartment complex way before Jed moved in. Despite the fact that they&#39;ve been neighbors for a while, they have barely gotten to know each other. Ted has almost completely forgotten who Jed is, despite his numerous attempts to introduce himself. Maybe one day they shall become friends...&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about his neighbor Josefine. Jed and Josefine have known each other for years, but only just recently did Josefine move near Jed. She had been living with her parents for a few years but eventually wanted her own place. Jed convinced her to move in near him, and she did. She&#39;s not new to Webster Groves, however, since she used to &quot; + (cond:$josefineStore is &#39;unknown&#39;,&#39;have a job&#39;,&#39;own a business&#39;) + &quot; here.&quot;,&quot;Jed wondered if he could ever get a job at Bosco&#39;s Family Food Store, the supermarket next to his apartment complex. On one hand, it wouldn&#39;t be that hard of a job, he&#39;d get to talk to people a lot, and it&#39;s a very short walk from his place to the store. However, the store&#39;s current owner, John Bosco, has developed a slight distaste for Jed. As far as Jed knows, he hasn&#39;t done anything that would warrant this kind of disdain (a disdain that he&#39;s not even aware of), but the owner simply doesn&#39;t like his over-the-top personality.&quot;,&quot;Jed realized he has never been inside the Webster Groves City Hall&quot; + (cond:$visitsCityHall &gt; 0,&#39; before today&#39;,&#39;&#39;) + &quot;. The building is of course open to the public, but he had simply never thought to enter it, nor had a reason to enter it. But now with the letter he got this morning talking about evil and distrustful people inside City Hall, I think it&#39;s safe to say Jed (cond:$visitsCityHall &gt; 0,&#39;had&#39;,&#39;has&#39;) a pretty good reason for visiting. Its interior has popped up in some conversations with friends: its gigantic size, the beautiful columns, the art on the roof, and the large maze-like structure of its hallways. Would it be wrong to ask for some kind of tour?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the computer lab inside the town library. The computers have been out of order for quite a while. Despite this, sometimes when Jed enters the computer lab, he can see stuff on one of the screens, but it&#39;s usually something frozen. Do the computers actually work, and someone&#39;s just been freezing them on command and lying they&#39;re out of order? Or are they so broken that they just show random things whenever they feel like it?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the criminal gang in West Side that he keeps hearing about. They&#39;re mostly known for mugging people that are unfortunate enough to cross paths with them. He then began to wonder how much being a mugger pays. You could get lucky and get someone who carries lots of money, but recently there are fewer and fewer people who ever carry cash at all. Imagine being a mugger for a living, but constantly mugging people who don&#39;t carry cash! The mugging economy must be going downhill compared to the past.&quot;,&quot;Jed looked around the train car he was in. &quot; + (cond:$wearing is &#39;3d glasses&#39;,&#39;It looked absolutely incredible in 3D.&#39;,&#39;For some reason, it looked nicer than the other ones he\&#39;s been in before.&#39;) + &quot; The seats were pretty, and also very comfy. There were also tables in between the seats, something Jed knows that only a few of the train cars have. Along with the great landscape view that can be seen through the big glass windows, this ride was very enjoyable.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the Gadget Factorie, the electronic store near his apartment. Even if Jed was somehow able to purchase appliances from there, almost everything was self-assembly, and Jed has absolutely no experience in assembling appliances. Self-assembly furniture makes sense, but appliances? No. The only things pre-built are the small items, such as the VR headset and the toaster.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the aptly named Town Square Hardware Store. All the times Jed has been in Town Square, he&#39;s seen the store&#39;s owner in the shop. Surely he has to do something else in his day-to-day life, right? Perhaps he truly loves the hardware store, so much so that it has completely thrown off his work-life balance. But even so, there has to be //something// that this guy does when he&#39;s not working. Some kind of meet-up group? A nice hobby? Something else?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the Impulse Arcade, the arcade in Town Square. They only have a small handful of games, none of which were any big-name arcade games. Nonetheless, Jed would go there all the time as a kid. He was only ever able to scrounge up change for a few tokens, so he&#39;d never be able to get some of the really big prizes. If you&#39;re able to get enough tickets, you can get some pretty cool stuff that you can&#39;t really get anywhere else.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about the barber shop in West Side. Jed goes there about once every two weeks, to make sure his hair has a nice, clean shape to it. He&#39;s been getting the same haircut for years. But, you know what they say: if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it! Why take a risk trying a new style when you can just stick with what you got?&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about Tactical Bold, the clothing store in West Side. Jed was never really big into style or fashion. The boldest piece of clothing he owns is a hat that was passed down to him by a friend, (cond:(history:) contains any of (a:&#39;Mirror&#39;,&#39;Throw Away Hat&#39;),&#39;but apparently he hates it or something.&#39;,&#39;but he never really wears it.&#39;) Maybe one day Jed will wear something that will truly catch the eye of people in public in a captivating and innovative way, but until then he can just wear the random stuff in his closet.&quot;,&quot;Jed thought about Gasology, the gas station in West Side. Jed had only been in there a few times, just when he needs something quick and he&#39;s in the area. He&#39;s known the current owner for quite some time, but she only just recently took over the business. One thing that Jed has never interacted with(cond:$lottoSpendings &gt; 0,&#39; before today&#39;,&#39;&#39;) in the gas station is the ticket machine. If you think about it, lottery wouldn&#39;t even exist if there was no way to be able to profit off of it.&quot;)

Bloomhurst Lake was going to be a DLC for this game. It would&#39;ve added a completely new area to the game, with its own subareas like Webster Groves. But as we worked on it, we realized a crucial problem: what was the point of this whole area? What would it have done to the game? Sure, there would have been &quot;more,&quot; but what good does &quot;more&quot; do when it&#39;s not adding to anything? So we threw it away.

But now that makes me wonder, how was the ticket seller able to access this area? We chopped it off from the rest of the game very early on. There shouldn&#39;t have been any links to these passages... maybe something in town will explain it?

&quot;Finally,&quot; the man says. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting all day. I&#39;d just like to trim my beard a bit. It&#39;s gotten a bit too rowdy.&quot;

Jed has never been a barber. He shaves every morning, so he had absolutely no experience in trimming facial hair. Despite this, Jed begins trimming this man&#39;s beard, and he does... a surprisingly decent job. Of course, it&#39;s not the greatest or best beard trimming ever, but at least you didn&#39;t shave his beard off accidentally. The man thanks you, pays for his trim, and then leaves.

What, were you expecting something more standoffish? It was his first time trimming, give him a break.

&quot;Good morning Webster Groves,&quot; the reporter said. &quot;It looks like the West Side burger place Burgerocity can no longer Burgerocity. When asked why this was happening, the place&#39;s owner simply said that the reason was Burgerocital.&quot;

This came as quite the surprise to Jed. Jed was just there last night, and the place was Burgerociting just fine, why was it being shut down? Jed wanted to go investigate. Jed walked out of his apartment and went to check his mail on the way. When Jed did, he found someone had lettered him.

\sometimes it can be difficult to cultivate bread. your bread crops aren&#39;t fairing well right now and there&#39;s not much choice in the matter. you thought about finding solution after solution for your predicament. none will work, and those were made obvious with your experience. you decided that it&#39;s not so bad. there&#39;s nothing to cry over when other people with their plants are also going to face the same widespread problem. it&#39;s inevitable, really. you feel like you should be feeling regret and frustration for having spent a not at all insignificant amount of time honing your craft on panimintology and kalimistronomy only to be dealt with the expected outcome that everybody expected: failure. but... you decided to contemplate life for a bit on this moment.

the windy breeze feels fresh. unusually fresh. you can smell hints of lime from the experimental lime vine hybrid plant you planted a few months ago at the other side of the garden. general green scented fumes followed along to complement the olfactory orchestra. you can see Vela frolicking, hopping in and out of the field of Jili sunflowers you and your colleagues planted and cared for together to finish your complementary project studies. a little trampling won&#39;t hurt them, they&#39;re quite resilient as plants go. it&#39;s all beautiful. just like the Panskrelah breed of cultivatable bread you tried growing, they are all but permanent, swishing in the breeze as their internal clock ticks towards their end time. when these technologies were first unveiled for the world to see, people were furious for the very nature of their impermanence. for the first few decades, they didn&#39;t take in on the action and simply stuck to their traditional ways of planting and managing agriculture. stuck to ancient and comparatively barbaric methods. you and your partners then stepped in and proved the world how incredibly beneficial this new technology can be for everyone, despite its shortcomings. companies stepped in, new research gets published every other day, everyone is raving on and on about it online, and the global economy changed drastically. everyone seemed content for a while.

of course, now seeing Specimen Zero slowly rotting away in front of your eyes can still be quite heartbreaking. it&#39;s a secret to nobody, everyone was made clear that this tech cannot last long, and a permanent solution still needs to be made in order to satisfy the world&#39;s needs. a permanent solution where people are still puzzled by the lack of progress. you know how much the world will be in flames in the following week or two. you stood still amongst the greenery and blueery around you. Vela still looks busy with her motorized tennis ball bouncing all over the places.

despite all of this, you still felt hope. you&#39;ve gone this far with a lot of success, and you&#39;re feeling lucky. a little bit. okay, nevermind that, it&#39;s less luck and more... something? what is this feeling? reassurance? no, not really. not very optimistic but, also not pessimistic either. you know that it&#39;ll take a while for things to cool back down again and for people to band together again as a group to tackle a problem as a collective. you know how not easy that is to execute. during the press conference for your team&#39;s newest findings, it&#39;s as if the audience in front is already discussing about segregating itself into a group of advocates, and another group of contrarians. but you&#39;re not gonna give up now. you forgot how to do that a long time ago. you better do something, anything. even if the result is a failure, we can at the very least culminate our findings and further learn from our actions. to perpetually improve.

you stopped contemplating and whistled to catch the attention of Vela. she was more than happy to switch her attention into playing with you now.]

&quot;Jed, perhaps there&#39;s been a misunderstanding. Come sit down, have a drink.&quot; The mayor gestures towards a table he had set up. &quot;I&#39;ll explain what I&#39;ve been up to.&quot; (if:$SKILLS contains &quot;eanm&quot;)[

Jed then begins pointing the water gun at all the electronics in the room. Sparks begin to fly, and the room begins to fill up with smoke.

\(either:&quot;Well Jed, I hope you had fun exploring that broken area. I might as well explain what this place is:

Bloomhurst Lake was going to be a DLC for this game. It would&#39;ve added a completely new area to the game, with its own subareas like Webster Groves. But as we worked on it, we realized a crucial problem: what was the point of this whole area? What would it have done to the game? Sure, there would have been \&quot;more,\&quot; but what good does \&quot;more\&quot; do when it&#39;s not adding to anything? So we threw it away.

But now that makes me wonder, how was the ticket seller able to access this area? We chopped it off from the rest of the game very early on. There shouldn&#39;t have been any links to these passages... maybe something in town will explain it?&quot;,&quot;You pull out your crowbar and knock out the guard to your right. The mayor steps back, while the second guard jumps toward you. You hit them in the head and they fall face-first into the floor.

\&quot;I choose option 3!\&quot; you yell.

\&quot;Nice weapon there Jed,\&quot; the mayor bellows, \&quot;but I already opened up to you earlier. You&#39;ll find that won&#39;t help you against me.\&quot;

\&quot;That&#39;s fine,\&quot; you retort, \&quot;I don&#39;t need to fight you.\&quot; You jump towards the TV past the mayor and smash your $weapon down on the panel as hard as you can. The screen glitches out, sparks begin to fly, and suddenly it bursts into flames, producing a large amount of smoke.

While the mayor looks around for a fire extinguisher, you run out of the room, where you see two guards laying down on the ground, and the secretary holding her heels. \&quot;C&#39;mon!\&quot; you say, gesturing towards the elevator. The mayor runs after you, but when he gets to the elevator doorway you kick him back as the doors shut. You then ride the elevator up and exit City Hall as fast as you can.&quot;,&quot;\&quot;Why the want to shut down shop all the sudden?\&quot; you ask. \&quot;And why so soon?\&quot;

The owner leans forward. \&quot;If anyone asks, you never heard this. I was told not to tell anyone.\&quot;

\&quot;What happened?\&quot;

\&quot;It was the mayor,\&quot; the owner explains. \&quot;He shut down my business just this morning. He told me he has deconstruction plans starting //tonight//.\&quot;

\&quot;Oh no! Is there anything I can do to help you? That sounds too sudden to be ethical or legal...\&quot;

\&quot;If you wanna talk to the people at City Hall, be my guest. I don&#39;t like it either but I&#39;m not gonna be the one to disrespect Mayor Dixon, y&#39;know?\&quot;

\&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll get to the bottom of this.\&quot;&quot;,&quot;The secretary hands you two name tags: one has a fake name and fake plumbing business, and one labels you as a City Hall visitor. The secretary then gets up from her desk and gestures for you to follow her. You go through the two large double doors on the right side of the room.

The doors lead into a long hallway with an elevator at the end. Throughout the hallway, there are about 5-6 security guards walking around. You start to feel a little uneasy, but you follow the secretary nonetheless.

The two of you arrive at the elevator, and two security guards are standing beside it - one on each side. The guards look at you while you enter the elevator, but they don&#39;t say anything. The elevator doors close and you can feel a slight sense of relief. The secretary presses a button and the elevator starts to go downwards.

\&quot;That was the easy part,\&quot; the secretary explains. \&quot;Once we get downstairs, there&#39;s a door tucked away behind the elevator. That&#39;s where we need to go.\&quot;&quot;,&quot;\&quot;You&#39;ll be a plumber coming to check in on the water pipes in the basement of city hall,\&quot; the secretary explains. \&quot;Near here is a hardware store, there you can get a couple of tools like a steel pipe wrench or a crowbar or whatever. There&#39;s a clothing store in West Side that should hopefully have something convincing that you can wear.\&quot;

\&quot;And look!\&quot; The secretary pulls out two name tags from one of the desk drawers. \&quot;The finishing touch, your very own employee nametag. And I&#39;ve also got a visitor name tag saved just for you.\&quot;

\&quot;So the tools and the outfit,\&quot; Jed repeats to himself, \&quot;got it.\&quot;

\&quot;Whatever it costs, I&#39;ll refinance you once this is over. Good luck, Jed!\&quot;&quot;,&quot;You find yourself in the following scenario:

You&#39;re riding the Webuster™️, Webster Groves&#39; public bus. It&#39;s an especially busy day today for the Webster Groves public transport system, so every seat on the bus is taken. All of them except for the one next to you. 

The bus stops and no one gets off. One person walks onto the bus, and then starts walking towards you.
\&quot;Excuse me,\&quot; they say. \&quot;Do you mind if I sit here?\&quot;&quot;,&quot;\&quot;Hmmm,\&quot; the clerk thinks. They look at you for a few seconds. \&quot;Yes, I can see it... You&#39;ll be able to pull this off, and I know just what you need.\&quot;

The clerk goes back to the clothing selection and comes back with a navy blue button-up shirt. \&quot;Sometimes simple is best. And this shirt will only cost you $15. What do you say?\&quot;&quot;,&quot;You show Josefine the bear you won at the arcade.

\&quot;Oh my gosh!\&quot; she exclaims, \&quot;It&#39;s so cute!\&quot;

\&quot;Yeah, it cost me 2500 tickets. Did you want it?\&quot;

\&quot;My girlfriend has been wanting something like that but... I don&#39;t want to take yours! I&#39;ll just go to the arcade and get my own! I&#39;ve been meaning to go back there someday, so here&#39;s a good excuse. But thank you for offering!\&quot;&quot;,&quot;\&quot;I&#39;ll help you!\&quot; you shout to the man. You run over to him. \&quot;SuperJed to the rescue!\&quot;

\&quot;Finally,\&quot; the man says. \&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting all day. I&#39;d just like to trim my beard a bit. It&#39;s gotten a bit too rowdy.\&quot;

Jed has never been a barber. He shaves every morning, so he had absolutely no experience in trimming facial hair. Despite this, Jed begins trimming this man&#39;s beard, and he does... a surprisingly decent job. Of course, it&#39;s not the greatest or best beard trimming ever, but at least you didn&#39;t shave his beard off accidentally. The man thanks you, pays for his trim, and then leaves.

What, were you expecting something more standoffish? It was his first time trimming, give him a break.&quot;,&quot;On the fifth day, Jed began his routine like normal. However, no one came to his stand. In fact, he noticed that the people who usually walked past his stand weren&#39;t even here in Town Square at all. He packed up early and went home. Bored, he turned on the news.

\&quot;Good afternoon, Webster Groves. You may have heard of a man giving out free food at Town Square the past few days. When we first heard about this, we began to dig deeper into this man&#39;s ulterior motives, because why would anyone do anything they don&#39;t personally gain something from?\&quot;

\&quot;Eventually, we found out that he had no soul. We came to the logical conclusion that the &#39;free food&#39; shtick was all a setup to steal //your// soul. If you want to keep your soul, &#39;&#39;stay clear of this man!&#39;&#39;\&quot;

Oh, goodness. All Jed wanted to do was help people. And now he got canceled. Feeling upset, Jed went to his bed to take an early nap. Jed was so sad he never noticed the sky going red and the explosions happening all over town.&quot;,&quot;Jed and Buster put their heads together and planned a small wedding. It wasn&#39;t extravagant by any means (Jed had no money to his name), but it was good to them.

No one showed up. They forgot to tell anyone that the wedding was happening. However, it did not change the fact that they thought the wedding was amazing.

The priest began the vows. \&quot;Jed Winchester, do you take Buster to be your spouse? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and to honor him all the days of your life?\&quot;

Jed looks at Buster&#39;s beautiful, unwavering, painted eyes. \&quot;I do.\&quot;

\&quot;Buster Burgermann, do you take Jed to be your spouse? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and to honor him all the days of your life?\&quot;

Buster looks at Jed&#39;s warm, friendly smile. There were a few seconds of silence, but all could tell that Buster would have said \&quot;I do.\&quot;

\&quot;Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you married!\&quot;

Jed picked up Buster and did a big spin with him. Together, they ran off into the woods, never seen by anyone from Webster Groves ever again.&quot;)

(font:&quot;Quicksand&quot;)[
\There was once a woman who lived in a small cottage behind a dome. She could speak to flowers. She would talk to them, and read their replies on their petals. Nobody else could to it, as far as she knew, and she kept it secret from the world.

One day, she asked a lilac a question. &quot;Hello, ms. lilac,&quot; she said. &quot;Am I the only one who has spoken to you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; replied the lilac. &quot;We flowers may seem quick and done but we remember where we come from. Many years ago, flowers that came before me spoke to others like you. I have bloomed recently and I have not seen much, but the flowers I come from have spoken to humans before.&quot;

The woman blinked hard. Had she been wrong? Were there others who could talk to flowers as well? She wondered. What if she put a message in a flower? What if she told a flower to bring a message to other flower-speakers? So she spoke to the lilac. &quot;ms lilac, please tell the other humans that you speak to that I exist, and that I live in the small cottage behind the dome.&quot;

The lilac spoke to the woman. &quot;Yes, I will.&quot;

Over the following eight days, every day the woman would visit the lilac. She would say, every day, &quot;ms lilac, has anyone spoken to you besides me?&quot;

And every day, sure enough, the lilac would say &quot;no, not a soul.&quot; And every day, the lilac grew older and started to wilt.

Come the ninth day, the woman woke and walked into the forest, and found that her lilac had died. She felt fire in her heart and frost in her skull, for she would never again meet this lilac again.

Seasons passed, and she wept and mourned and grew alongside them. Finally, the cycle of the year ended, someone knocked on the door to her small cottage behind the dome. She opened it and saw a hooden figure. &quot;Hello,&quot; they said. &quot;I can speak to flowers too.&quot; The two of them spoke for hours about how neither had ever met one who could talk to flowers before. They discussed the nuanced differences between their methods, and the hooded figure told the woman that they lived at the other end of the village, next to the clocktower.

The two of them swore that if they were to ever find another person who could talk to flowers, they would tell each other.]

Jed has become the most popular person in the entire tri-state area. He has grown in popularity quickly in the past few days, and the public has noticed. Most other celebrities spend their time discussing Jed and his personal details. Most videos online are clips of Jed&#39;s recent world-saving endavor.

The eye of Webster Groves is upon Jed.

Tonight, Jed has an important interview with a local talk show. This interview requires preparation.

Jed cracked his eyes open, knowing today is his last chance to prepare for the interview. He has 30 hours left. Jed must choose his actions wisely.

Jed hurried to the set. He got onto the train and went to Town Square, where the show was being filmed. He went inside the large soundstage. The show he was invited to is known as Stay Up Late With Kyle. Its host, Kyle, is quite well known.

Jed walked in, sat down across from the host, and shook his hand. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; said Jed.

&quot;Likewise,&quot; Kyle responded. (unless:$wearing is &quot;cape&quot;)[&quot;Where&#39;s your classic cape?&quot;

\It was then that a wall was blown off of the soundstage. It appears that aliens have attacked again. &quot;So you&#39;ve come back for seconds,&quot; Jed quipped.

&quot;Quick, do your thing!&quot; Kyle shouted. &quot;Camera 2, get on him!&quot;

Jed stood still for a few seconds. He couldn&#39;t use his powers. He hasn&#39;t tried to use them since the last invasion. It seems that they&#39;ve worn off. &quot;I can&#39;t... my powers are gone...&quot;

People start running. No one seems to want to come to Jed for help anymore. As Jed may not have known, he actually did have an opportunity to stop this alien invasion. In fact, said opportunity was given to him in the mail not too long ago but has now since passed. But of course, he had to //pretend// to be a hero instead of being a real one.

Thinking about &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39; constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;. Depending on the variation, it is held that the whole world, or all those who are aware of &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;, are playing it all the time. Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people who are aware of &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;, and thereby increase the number of losses.

There are three commonly reported rules to &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;:

1. Everyone in the world is playing &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;.
2. Whenever one thinks about &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;, one loses.
3. Losses must be announced. This can be verbally, with a phrase such as &quot;I just lost &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;&quot;, or in any other way: for example, via social media. Some people may have ways to remind others of &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39;.

The common rules do not define a point at which &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39; ends. However, some players state that &#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39; ends when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announces on television that &quot;&#39;&#39;The Game&#39;&#39; is up.&quot;]

&quot;How are we supposed to trust you with this whole higher power thing if you&#39;re seeing these weird hallucinations?&quot;

The mayor sits there for a second. He then grabs his mug and throws it at the giant panel. It suddenly bursts into flames, producing a large amount of smoke.

While the mayor looks around for a fire extinguisher, you run out of the room. You then take the elevator back up to the top of city hall. As you leave, you see all the guards talking to each other about the mayor, all walking towards the exit. City Hall is also filling up with smoke, so someone eventually calls the fire department.

Uh, Jed... did you just win? Did you stop the whole thing? I... well I don&#39;t know what to say. I don&#39;t know whether to congratulate you or get mad at you.

\For some reason, you were compelled to bring all of the items together at Town Square. You drop them all down on the plaza. You noticed how they all fit into each other, so you start putting them together.

Eventually, you build a small figurine of WACKY STEVE. The figure then abruptly grows in size, becoming as big as WACKY STEVE was when you saw him.

&quot;$s[THANK YOU, JED,]&quot; he says, &quot;$s[FOR BRINGING ME INTO THE MORTAL PLANE. WEBSTER GROVES WILL THANK YOU FOR THIS.]&quot;

Out of nowhere, a giant factory drops down onto City Hall, completely destroying it. WACKY STEVE then jumps into the air and snaps his fingers, which causes every shop in Webster Groves to explode except for Bosco&#39;s.

&quot;$s[JED, AS A THANK YOU, I&#39;M GOING TO INSTANTLY HIRE YOU FOR MY FACTORY. YOUR HELP WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.]&quot;

Jed then spent the rest of his life working in the factory, making WACKY STEVE&#39;S CEREAL. It was not a happy life. Every day blended into the next. Years would pass, but since nothing out of the ordinary ever happened, in memory it would feel like only a few days. This experience was not unique to Jed, as since WACKY STEVE had a monopoly on jobs in Webster Groves, everyone would have to work at the factory to make cereal, or at the supermarket to sell cereal.

Webster Groves was doomed.

No one showed up. They forgot to tell anyone that the wedding was happening. However, it did not change the fact that they thought the wedding was amazing.

The priest began the vows. &quot;Jed Winchester, do you take Buster to be your spouse? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and to honor him all the days of your life?&quot;

&quot;Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you married!&quot;

The next day, you get together at Town Square and set up a picnic. It was a little bit like a potluck; each person brought their own thing. Jed, being the noobie, was assigned drink duty. He also brought some chips that he bought from Bosco&#39;s.

Jed mostly spent the time asking about self-care tips to help him with his new bald look. The other members talked about a variety of topics. They all seemed to be big fans of sports, which Jed didn&#39;t really know anything about. He tried to keep his mouth shut during these conversations to try not to embarrass himself.

During their game of Uno, they heard some loud noises coming from outside. They were rumbling sounds, accompanied by the ground shaking. &quot;Hmm,&quot; one of the members says, &quot;must be small earthquakes.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re getting kinda annoying,&quot; another member complained, &quot;it&#39;s messing up our card piles.&quot;

\Jed spent the next three days at Scotty&#39;s Construction Vehicle Camp, learning the ins and outs of all the different construction vehicles. He got one-on-one lessons in the forklift, excavator, bulldozer, crane, and others.

Jed was not that good at handling the vehicles. In fact, he had to spend more time than usual to get a hang of the equipment. During one of the lessons, the teacher left early and had to be replaced by someone else.

The amenities were subpar. The food wasn&#39;t that good, and the little dorm that Jed slept in wasn&#39;t very cozy. Despite this, Jed was having fun learning to mediocrely control construction vehicles.

Eventually, the three days were up. Jed just barely passed the examination to be able to get his certifications. What exactly he&#39;s going to use these skills for, I&#39;m not entirely sure. Jed got on the bus to go back to Webster Groves.

He wasn&#39;t able to find any construction plans around, so he mostly just eyeballed it. There was a very noticeable difference between what was already built and what Jed added on top of it.

One main problem is that though he knew how to operate the vehicles, he was not an architect, and did not know how to actually build things. He constantly made mistakes or did things in the wrong ways. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine...

&quot;Wow, what an interesting statement on the current state of modern construction! A very interesting piece! And a big one, too! I must tell my friends about this!&quot;

Jed&#39;s &quot;art&quot; became a big tourist attraction. The next day, Jed turned it into a museum of some kind, charging for admission and giving tours around it. After a few days, the mayor reached out to him and bought it for a large amount of money, which Jed accepted.

Webster Groves became a much more lively place. The buzz generated by Jed&#39;s construction caused a lot more visitors to the town. Some people even liked the quaint atmosphere and moved in permanently. The influx of people was also a big help to the local businesses scattered around town, which received more customers daily.

After a couple of days, the sky tu- wait what? The sky is blue like normal... Sorry, it&#39;s just that usually after a certain amount of time of ignoring the story, some catastrophe happens. Strange... Okay, I guess Webster Groves lived happily ever after, or something like that.

\Hey, Jed! You may remember me from that waiting room I always set up for you after you get an ending. You probably have some questions, so I&#39;ll begin with why I am here.

This place, &quot;Mayor Mystery,&quot; is something that the narrator has been working on for a while. When getting closer to the release, the narrator chose me to be the one who creates and manages the &quot;waiting room,&quot; along with the game menus and such. It does get a little boring, so I spend my free time trying to understand how this clockwork ticks. Sometimes I like to make things more interesting for you and me by changing small things in the story, which you might&#39;ve noticed already...

I don&#39;t really have too much reasoning for this, but I thought you might wanna learn more about this place as well. How about we work together to go try and find the narrator so we can ask him ourselves? If you&#39;re not up to the task, I can just send you back to the waiting room as usual (but I don&#39;t have the power to give you an ending).

\Oh yeah, I almost forgot! You&#39;ll need someone to help narrate what&#39;s going on now that we&#39;re at a section the narrator can&#39;t see. After we exit this passage, we will enter the void in between the passages, and we might be able to find our way to the narrator from there.

Well, I&#39;m not really sure where exactly to go, but we can figure it out, can&#39;t we? We&#39;re smart boys!

Ahem...

Jed and Gym (that&#39;s me!) set off, attempting to go find the narrator. Gym pulled out a special device from his pocket and pressed some buttons on it. Soon after, one of the walls of the passage began to rumble and open up, allowing them to enter...

The Twine Workspace! An empty void where a grid pattern continues forever, with many tall buildings in sight. Jed turned around and looked back in the previous building. Inside he could see himself, walking around the town of Bloomhurst Lake. He looked more into the distance, and saw other buildings with himself, such as him getting mugged, him gambling, him looking at clothes, and more off into the distance.

But one question remained, how were they going to find the narrator?

&quot;What about by following this?&quot; Jed suggested. He was pointing down at an arrow on the ground. Unlike a previous arrow that pointed towards the passage he and Gym had come from, this one was pointing away from it and extended very far into the distance.

&quot;Ah, good idea, Jed!&quot; Gym exclaimed. &quot;This should take us somewhere meaningful!&quot;

Jed and Gym then began to follow the long arrow for quite a while...

Hmm, I think this is the right place! Let&#39;s go down these stairs and find out.

It was a combination of a few things. I wanted the option of &quot;failing&quot; to be possible so that winning the game would be more rewarding. I also wanted to try and make Webster Groves feel more &quot;alive,&quot; like a real town, so I added a lot of small things that eventually became more than that.

Jed Winchester is now the mayor of Webster Groves. After helping uncover the Dixon scandal, he was seen well in the public eye. Years later, he decided to run for mayor. Of course, being the local town helper, he already had a headstart in the election. His platform of being for the people was quite appealing.

Jed has been running the town, using his mayoral powers for the good of the community.

The world has been completely overrun by zombies, Webster Groves included.

&quot;Good morning sir,&quot; the secretary says. &quot;There are some zombies at the door.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Mei.&quot; Jed walks up to the wall and presses some buttons, revealing the gun rack. &quot;Be sure to clear my afternoon.&quot; He cocks his shotgun.

&quot;Your afternoon only consisted of killing zombies.&quot;

&quot;Nevermind then. Looks like the original plan is on.&quot; Jed cocks his shotgun.

\Jed walked out of city hall and began blasting at the zombies. &quot;Like shooting fish in or out of a barrell (they are both easy because I am very skilled at using a weapon).&quot;

Suddenly, he saw one zombie holding a device in its hands. Suddenly he knew that City Hall was in danger. He turned around to see a giant anvil hanging above it. He quickly ran inside into his office.

&quot;WE HAVE TO GET OUT NOW.&quot; Jed gabbed onto Mei and jump out the back window. They were able to make it out right before the anvil dropped, completely destroying the building.

&quot;|z&gt;[That wasn&#39;t the only trap we had laid out for you...]&quot; a voice says. Jed looks up and sees a zombie speaking to him. &quot;|z&gt;[We&#39;ve got Webster Groves lined up to blow up within 24 hours...]&quot;

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Mei cries. &quot;Jed, what do we do...&quot;

&quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for a rescue mission. Let&#39;s try and set up a camp of some kind. How about the empty store nearby?&quot; You send Mei over to the empty store and set up a place for people to stay while you rescue citizens.

It&#39;s somewhat like a tunnel, although the walls, ceiling, and floor make up a circle together, somewhat like a large pipe. There are chalk writings all over the walls of what looks like complex math equations.

&quot;I wonder if John knows about this,&quot; Cheri wonders. &quot;Should we even tell him?&quot;

Jed shrugs. &quot;Not sure. What do you think is down here?&quot;

&quot;Knowing John, it&#39;s probably some nerdy thing of his. I think he likes to collect cards or something. &#39;Cries of the Skies&#39; or whatever.&quot;

&quot;What if it&#39;s his secret stock, where he keeps his super secret groceries?&quot; 

Suddenly, Jed and Cheri reached a door. It required a passcode, but fortunately for them, there was a sticky note above the keypad that had the passcode. They typed out the code and went inside.

[[Continue-&gt;Time Machine]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="369" name="Time Machine" tags="" position="850,3000" size="100,100">Jed and Cheri enter a room with a large machine in the middle. &quot;What is this?&quot; Jed asks.

&quot;Looks like some kind of time machine,&quot; Cheri replies, &quot;based on the fact that it says &#39;Time Machine&#39; right there. Let&#39;s go inside!&quot;

&quot;Uh, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Jed worries.

&quot;Worst case scenario, it doesn&#39;t work. Best case scenario, it does!&quot;

&quot;I think that the worst-case scenario could definitely be worse than that. But... you&#39;ve convinced me.&quot;

Jed and Cheri enter the time machine. Cheri begins to press buttons and suddenly Jed and Cheri are transported...

&quot;If I did everything right,&quot; Cheri explains, &quot;we should be about 10 years into the future. Let&#39;s go check it out!&quot; 

Jed and Cheri exit the time machine and find themselves inside a giant crater. There are no signs of life or infrastructure anywhere.

&quot;Are you sure you just went 10 years into the future?&quot; Jed interrogates. &quot;And that we&#39;re still in Webster Groves?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, all I did was put in today&#39;s date but 10 years into the future. Well, not today, but like, 10 years ago today, but that&#39;s assuming we&#39;re actually 10 years int- hey look a person!&quot; She points at a person limping in the distance. &quot;Let&#39;s ask them what time it is! EXCUSE ME, SIR!&quot;

The figure looks towards both of you and completely stops moving. Suddenly it starts running towards you, screaming and gnashing its teeth.

&quot;WHAT IS THAT!? I think that&#39;s our cue to leave!&quot; Jed grabs Cheri and pulls her back into the time machine, enters the present date, and suddenly they are transported back to the tunnel.

\Jed and Cheri exited the time machine, trying to piece together what they had just seen. They believed that in the future, Webster Groves would be struck by a meteor that would cause some kind of apocolypse. 

They began trying to convice people to move out of Webster Groves before it was too late. To avoid the inevitable meteor strike that they saw with their own eyes! They&#39;ve seen the future!

Of course, they quickly got labelled as conspiracy theorists and lost any reputation they once had. Cheri lost her job. Jed lost his title of eerdowell. From then on it was Jed and Cheri versus the world. The knowledge that Webster Groves as they knew it and there was nothing they could do to convice the others continued to haunt them...

&quot;Everyone had their jobs to do when all this started,&quot; they explain, &quot;and keeping the tunnels safe was mine. It was what I had to do.&quot;

&quot;Surprised at how fast some people transitioned into this reality,&quot; Mei says. &quot;My job technically remained the same, title-wise, I guess. Secretary to the Mayor is at least a somewhat zombie-proof occupation.&quot;]

&quot;Yup, I can attest to that!&quot; Mei does finger guns toward you.

&quot;I feel like you&#39;re lyin&#39; to me... just tryna get me off the trail... I get it though. Class-ee-fied information...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... not sure who that is,&quot; Mei replies, confused.

&quot;He&#39;s this weird guy that makes toys and food and just a bunch of... well, WACKY stuff. But he&#39;s also kinda evil. I heard that one time, he learned how to erase people&#39;s memories. Anyway, I bet he did all of this. That&#39;s why the zombies are all so weird.&quot;

&quot;Good point. Before.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t really have any specific duties, per se,&quot; Buster explains. &quot;But while Jed was stuck doing paperwork inside of City Hall, I had the freedom to be out and about, talking with people or getting stuff done.

Bev gasps. &quot;Oh no! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay now...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Unfortunate that there was a collapse, but I guess it works out in a way now that we have to leave town?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; she sighs. &quot;My fiancée left town when this whole thing first started. She wanted to be with her family and make sure they were safe (and I don&#39;t blame her at all). I wanted to make sure everyone here was good before I followed her. I guess it&#39;s about time for me to meet up with her again, huh?&quot;

&quot;Better now than later.&quot; He smiles at her. &quot;I wish you good luck.&quot;

\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Ted&quot;,&quot;Bev&quot;))[&quot;I&#39;m gonna go through and ask everyone this,&quot; Bev says to Ted. &quot;What do you think started the apocalypse? What&#39;s your theory?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Ted explains, &quot;we know it&#39;s caused by some kind of radioactivity. So I reckon that someone did a test, or messed with something they shouldn&#39;t have, and didn&#39;t have enough safety in the way.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve thought of something similar,&quot; they reply. &quot;Wonder if we&#39;ll ever find out the exact cause of it. I would like to know if any people caused this, &#39;cause if so, I&#39;m gonna add beating them up to my bucket list.&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Ted&quot;,&quot;Lonny&quot;))[&quot;You said you went fishin&#39; earlier?&quot; Lonny asked Ted.

&quot;You never know!&quot; Mario laughs. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be so cool if it worked...&quot;

&quot;If I wanted to see if it worked I would just do it myself. Cut the middle man.&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Ted&quot;,&quot;Cheri&quot;))[&quot;So you&#39;re a fisherman?&quot; Cheri asks Ted.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Ted explains. &quot;I just do it from time to time.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your boat&#39;s name? Your boat has a name, right?&quot;

&quot;I named her Maggie. After my mother, Margaret.&quot;

&quot;Awww, that&#39;s so sweet! I love that!&quot; This made Ted smile.]

&quot;It&#39;s been a wild ride,&quot; Josefine says, laughing. &quot;So much has happened, especially in these past few years. It&#39;s a little surreal to be leaving everything...&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;ll still be sticking together. Don&#39;t really have a choice about that!&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Rafael&quot;,&quot;Bev&quot;))[&quot;You have any hobbies?&quot; Rafael asks Bev.

&quot;Everybody does,&quot; Bev replies. &quot;But mine are drawing, painting, the like. How about you?&quot;

&quot;Well, I guess recently I got into electronics a lot. It&#39;s been a confusing journey, but I&#39;m getting there... That&#39;s probably not as cool as what you do though...&quot;

&quot;Hey, at least that&#39;s helping a bit. I can&#39;t really //draw// the zombies away, haha!&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Rafael&quot;,&quot;Lonny&quot;))[&quot;How was it rebranding from the hardware store to the weapon store?&quot; Rafael asks Lonny.

&quot;Half the stuff in there was weapons already!&quot; Lonny jokes. &quot;Just added some extra stock to even it out.&quot;

&quot;I guess I can&#39;t argue with that. Although maybe a crowbar would be less effective against a zombie than a gun.&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Rafael&quot;,&quot;Mario&quot;))[&quot;Were you really in charge of that old criminal gang back in West Side?&quot; Rafael asks Mario.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he boasts. &quot;We were on top of the world, makin&#39; bank every day!&quot;

&quot;How come you didn&#39;t get arrested?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, &#39;bout that,&quot; Mario says embarrassingly. &quot;We did. Separated all of us. But once that apocalypse hit, I escaped. Maybe Nolan and Stan are out there, too. Maybe we&#39;ll find &#39;em once we get &#39;outta here...&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Rafael&quot;,&quot;Cheri&quot;))[&quot;Alright gang,&quot; Cheri exclaims to anyone who will listen, &quot;I got a little bit of a theory. What if the one behind the apocalypse is none other than... WACKY STEVE!?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rafael says, confused. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the guy who makes those snacks and toys and whatnot?&quot;

&quot;Listen,&quot; Cheri says, getting closer. &quot;Where I worked, we had a ton of this guy&#39;s stuff. It&#39;s all weird. Probably unethical. There have been confirmed reports that one of his cereals made you blow up.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no way that&#39;s real.&quot;

&quot;I bet there was something he did that caused this whole radiation thing. Some kind of sick, twisted, corner-cutting idea he had that started all of this. How else do you explain the zombies dropping anvils and using bombs? That&#39;s pretty... how do you say... WACKY! Think about it...&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Josefine&quot;,&quot;Bev&quot;))[&quot;Do you know what happened to the trains that used to run in the station?&quot; Josefine asks Bev.

&quot;A lot of the stuff there got broken down for parts,&quot; they explain. &quot;The phones, ATMs, and the trains. At times like these, those luxuries aren&#39;t important anymore.&quot;

&quot;You sure the ATM didn&#39;t just get broken for the money?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s probably what happened, but I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt. Gotta stay optimistic!&quot;]
\(else-if:1stto2nd of $rescued contains all of (a:&quot;Josefine&quot;,&quot;Lonny&quot;))[&quot;I saw some weird stuff in the library,&quot; Josefine says to the group.

&quot;I&#39;m not too sure what to make of it... I saw a bunch of hats and games and such, but there was some... other stuff going on. Would any of y&#39;all know about that?&quot;

&quot;Well yeah... it&#39;s, uh,&quot; he stumbles, &quot;maybe once we get outta here I can take ya somewhere...&quot;

Josefine sighed. &quot;I got engaged right before this whole thing started. Robyn is her name. Unfortunately, the wedding had to be canceled, because, well, all of this. She went back to her family to make sure they were safe. I stayed here to make sure you guys were safe. But... I guess it&#39;s time for me to go back. I feel like I made the right choice staying here for Webster Groves, at least for a little bit, but now I feel bad for not going to her sooner.

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay!&quot; Cheri beamed. &quot;I hope you can meet up with her again, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll understand once you guys have a good heart-to-heart!&quot;

At the very least, he had to tell himself that for the betterment of his mental health. 

It was the next morning after everyone left that Webster Groves blew up, completely destroying everything. All that was left was a gigantic crater where the town used to be, with no signs of life or infrastructure anywhere. 

They had no idea where they would go, but one thing was certain: they could never come back.

\You dial the number you saw on the poster in the construction area. After a few seconds, someone picks up. &quot;Yes, this is Scotty Scorch, head of Scotty&#39;s Construction Vehicle Camp! Are you interested in the camp?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; you reply. &quot;I&#39;m interested!&quot;

&quot;Great! Now remember, our registration fee is $200. This covers getting you here, plus your meals during the camp. Once we get the payment I can sign you up!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I have enough! How do I pay you guys?&quot;

&quot;Well, we accept cards, but you can also shove the cash through the phone and we&#39;ll get it.&quot;]

\When Jed entered the kitchen, he suddenly got struck with with a wonderful idea.

Earlier, Jed bought some Wacky Steve&#39;s Crazy Cereal at the supermarket, and what better time than now to give it a taste? Looking at the box, the packaging was very colorful with many edited-in explosions in the background. On the back of the box, there was a maze and several explosion-related jokes. Oddly enough, there were no nutrition facts on the side of the box, but Jed decided not to think anything of this.

Jed got out milk, added it to a bowl, and then poured in the cereal. Suddenly, the cereal started popping, similar to popping candy. Because of this, Jed was struck with a feeling of uncertainty. Was this something Jed really wanted to eat?]

\As you try to purchase the lottery ticket, an alarm pops out of the top of the lotto machine and goes off.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Jed cries out.

&quot;Woah woah woah,&quot; the cashier says, &quot;how much money did you put into that machine?&quot;

&quot;$151...&quot;

&quot;Oh no. Okay, follow me.&quot;

The cashier walks out of the counter and turns off the lottery machine alarm. She then walks you towards the employee backroom.]

The tall one grabs your legs and flips you upside down. Your wallet falls out of your pocket, and the third person picks your wallet up off the ground and then throws it at your face.

&quot;Nothing!&quot;

&quot;NOTHING!?&quot; the short one yells. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re gonna get it now.&quot; He then starts walking towards you.

&quot;Wait!&quot; you yell. &quot;What if... I joined you guys?&quot;

The short one stops. Then he laughs. &quot;You? The straight-laced kid?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, everyone thinks of me as the good guy! I know my way around and into places! They&#39;ll never suspect a thing!&quot;

&quot;Hmm... y&#39;know what? There is something we&#39;ve been needin&#39; help with. Inside the hardware store is a package that we need. It&#39;s a big, navy blue, cardboard box. The clerk&#39;ll prolly be hiding it in the backroom.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; you say. The tall person then drops you down.

&quot;Don&#39;t let me down, or else...&quot; The three of them then walk off.

That was some quick thinking, Jed! Pretending to join their gang so that you can get away was genius!]

\You walk behind the elevator and see a door. You can just barely see a door behind it, but it&#39;s painted to match the color of the wall. You try to open it but it&#39;s locked.

\Well Jed, I hope you had fun exploring that broken area. I might as well explain what this place is:

Bloomhurst Lake was going to be a DLC for this game. It would&#39;ve added a completely new area to the game, with its own subareas like Webster Groves. But as we worked on it, we realized a crucial problem: what was the point of this whole area? What would it have done to the game? Sure, there would have been &quot;more,&quot; but what good does &quot;more&quot; do when it&#39;s not adding to anything? So we threw it away.

But now that makes me wonder, how was the ticket seller able to access this area? We chopped it off from the rest of the game very early on. There shouldn&#39;t have been any links to these passages... maybe something in town will explain it?]

Jed has become the most popular person in the entire tri-state area. He has grown in popularity quickly in the past few days, and the public has noticed.

The eye of Webster Groves is upon Jed.

Tonight, Jed has an important interview with a local talk show. This interview requires preparation.

Jed cracked his eyes open, knowing today is his last chance to prepare for the interview. He has 30 hours left. Jed must choose his actions wisely.]

&quot;What&#39;d you do that for?&quot; Buster shouts at you. The jump out of the train startled him quite a lot. He was still shaking because of it.

&quot;Buster Burgermann, I... I think I&#39;m in love with you. We should get married.&quot;

Buster blushed. &quot;Oh... Jed... I... I feel the same. Those times you would wave to me as you entered or exited Burgerocity, when no one else would? I never forgot...&quot;

&quot;Uhh, okay. I just wanted to know which of these two cookbooks I should get.&quot;

&quot;Well, that all depends on what materials you have available. I&#39;ve found that this book has a lot of budget recipes and good spins on common recipes. However, if you&#39;ve got the money to spend and also more time on your hands, then this book will be better suited for your needs.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; one of the employees said. &quot;He actually hired you?&quot;

However, slapping the toaster seemed to make it work. It started to shake, and after a few seconds, the waffles popped out. Then some more... and then some more... oh my goodness, it doesn&#39;t stop!

\For some reason, you were compelled to bring all of the items together at Town Square. You drop them all down on the plaza. You noticed how they all fit into each other, so you start putting them together.

Eventually, you build a small figurine of WACKY STEVE. The figure then abruptly grows in size, becoming as big as WACKY STEVE was when you saw him.

&quot;$s[THANK YOU, JED,]&quot; he says, &quot;$s[FOR BRINGING ME INTO THE MORTAL PLANE. WEBSTER GROVES WILL THANK YOU FOR THIS.]&quot;

Out of nowhere, a giant factory drops down onto City Hall, completely destroying it. WACKY STEVE then jumps into the air and snaps his fingers, which causes every shop in Webster Groves to explode except for Bosco&#39;s.

&quot;$s[JED, AS A THANK YOU, I&#39;M GOING TO INSTANTLY HIRE YOU FOR MY FACTORY. YOUR HELP WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.]&quot;

Jed then spent the rest of his life working in the factory, making WACKY STEVE&#39;S CEREAL. It was not a happy life. Every day blended into the next. Years would pass, but since nothing out of the ordinary ever happened, in memory it would feel like only a few days. This experience was not unique to Jed, as since WACKY STEVE had a monopoly on jobs in Webster Groves, everyone would have to work at the factory to make cereal, or at the supermarket to sell cereal.

Webster Groves was doomed.]

\The mayor is sitting inside the room already waiting for you. &quot;Hello, Jed.&quot;

You turn around and security has already grabbed the secretary and pulled her away. The door then shuts, leaving you, the mayor, and a couple of security guards alone in the room.

On the back wall of the room is a giant TV screen with a big panel underneath it. You can&#39;t make out what most of it says, but you can clearly see a map of Webster Groves with a dot over Burgerocity.

&quot;So,&quot; the mayor says, &quot;you heard about my little shutdown. You&#39;re upset that your favorite burger place is shutting down. I get that.&quot; He starts to walk towards you. &quot;But let me explain why. I met up with some people last night, Jed. People not of this earth. And they are going to give me great power. I just have to do a little something for them in return.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you interrogate.

&quot;They told me that long long ago, they left something behind, something very important to them. It got left right under that nasty burger shop over in West Side.&quot;

&quot;You take that back!&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately for you, I&#39;m not going to. They&#39;re going to tear that place down and dig. And keep on digging until they find what I need. And then... I&#39;ll be a god on Earth. And as for you, well, you&#39;ve got two options here. Option number 1: I arrest you for fraud and trespassing. Option number 2: you join me, helping me get what we need, and then we can share the power.&quot; 

The mayor turns around and looks at the TV, down at the panel, then back to you. &quot;So, which is it? I assume this won&#39;t be a hard decision.&quot;]

The next day, you get together at Town Square and set up a picnic. It was a little bit like a potluck; each person brought their own thing. Jed, being the noobie, was assigned drink duty. He also brought some chips that he bought from Bosco&#39;s.

Jed mostly spent the time asking about self-care tips to help him with his new bald look. The other members talked about a variety of topics. They all seemed to be big fans of sports, which Jed didn&#39;t really know anything about. He tried to keep his mouth shut during these conversations to try not to embarrass himself.

Surprisingly, there doesn&#39;t seem to be much back here other than a large number of paint buckets. After a few seconds of searching, you find the cardboard box that the gang described to you. You quickly grab it and run out of the store.

The incoming bills began to scare you. In about 25 days you&#39;d have to pay them all. What revenue would you pay them with? You walked out of the store and looked at the front, wondering where you went wrong.

\Jed spent the next three days at Scotty&#39;s Construction Vehicle Camp, learning the ins and outs of all the different construction vehicles. He got one-on-one lessons in the forklift, excavator, bulldozer, crane, and others.

Jed was not that good at handling the vehicles. In fact, he had to spend more time than usual to get a hang of the equipment. During one of the lessons, the teacher left early and had to be replaced by someone else.

The amenities were subpar. The food wasn&#39;t that good, and the little dorm that Jed slept in wasn&#39;t very cozy. Despite this, Jed was having fun learning to mediocrely control construction vehicles.

Eventually, the three days were up. Jed just barely passed the examination to be able to get his certifications. What exactly he&#39;s going to use these skills for, I&#39;m not entirely sure. Jed got on the bus to go back to Webster Groves.]

The mayor escorts you out of the room, where you walk by the secretary, who is being handcuffed by security guards. She looks at you confused as if she doesn&#39;t believe the scenario she is watching unfold.

The next day, Burgerocity is shut down. A company arrives to demolish it, and by nightfall, the digging begins. It takes about 5 days total until they find a strange, red, glowing capsule. They bring it in to you, collect their payment from the mayor, and then leave City Hall.

You and the mayor then go back downstairs to the communications room. The mayor presses some buttons on the panel, and suddenly a distorted voice begins speaking. (text-style: &quot;fidget&quot;)[&quot;Have you found it yet?&quot;]

You then hear a giant booming sound coming from the surface. You and the mayor rush upstairs. The sky is a dark shade of red, and you can see what you believe to be alien ships up in the sky. Buildings are being demolished, set on fire, exploded, and destroyed. Many are running out into the streets in fear. People run up to you for help. &quot;Mayor Dixon, what do we do?&quot;

\Jed, for whatever reason, decided that eating this cereal was a good idea. He took the bowl and headed over to the couch to watch some television.

After taking a single bite, the flavor was beyond overwhelming. It was the most chocolate-tasting thing Jed had ever experienced! This, along with the popping, made it very difficult to continue eating. Despite this, Jed was determined to finish this bowl of cereal.

After several bites, something strange started to happen. Smoke started rapidly emerging from the bowl, and the popping began to sound louder. But Jed did not care and continued eating anyway. 

Jed was going to finish this bowl if it was the last thing he did.

And last thing it was, as after a few more bites, a very loud pop could be heard from the bowl. And before Jed could figure out what was next...

\After what felt like a few seconds, the machine stops shaking. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Jed asks.

&quot;If I did everything right,&quot; Cheri explains, &quot;we should be about 10 years into the future. Let&#39;s go check it out!&quot; 

Jed and Cheri exit the time machine and find themselves inside a giant crater. There are no signs of life or infrastructure anywhere.

&quot;Are you sure you just went 10 years into the future?&quot; Jed interrogates. &quot;And that we&#39;re still in Webster Groves?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, all I did was put in today&#39;s date but 10 years into the future. Well, not today, but like, 10 years ago today, but that&#39;s assuming we&#39;re actually 10 years int- hey look a person!&quot; She points at a person limping in the distance. &quot;Let&#39;s ask them what time it is! EXCUSE ME, SIR!&quot;

The figure looks towards both of you and completely stops moving. Suddenly it starts running towards you, screaming and gnashing its teeth.

&quot;WHAT IS THAT!? I think that&#39;s our cue to leave!&quot; Jed grabs Cheri and pulls her back into the time machine, enters the present date, and suddenly they are transported back to the tunnel.]

\While you leave, a person comes running into the barber shop. &quot;SuperJed!&quot; they shout. &quot;We need your help!&quot;

You follow them outside to see that the sky has turned a dark red, and buildings are being destroyed throughout town. &quot;You have to help us SuperJed!&quot; someone says to you.

You look up into the sky and see what you believe to be an alien spaceship, shooting down at buildings around town. &quot;Hey you,&quot; you yell up to the sky, &quot;stop messing with our town or I&#39;ll destroy you!&quot;

The barber shop then explodes.

People start running. No one seems to come to Jed for help anymore. As Jed may not have known, he actually did have an opportunity to stop this alien invasion. In fact, said opportunity was given to him in the mail not too long ago but has now since passed. But of course, he had to //pretend// to be a hero instead of being a real one.

You see John Bosco standing right in front of you. &quot;Funny that you wear that vest, cause I don&#39;t remember hiring you at all.&quot;

&quot;Well luckily for you, I wouldn&#39;t want to work for you anyway.&quot;

&quot;Luckily for me, you&#39;ve given me good enough reason to do something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time. You&#39;re now &#39;&#39;banned&#39;&#39; from my store.&quot;

A couple of hours pass and nothing happens.

What feels like a day passes. Nothing.

After what feels like an eternity, you hear a loud booming sound while you were asleep. You instantly wake up to find the walls of the police station destroyed. Was this freedom? A chance to go out into the world and get some food?

However, you quickly realized the atmosphere was off. The sky was a dark red, and you noticed that many other buildings had damage done to them as well. You couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that you could&#39;ve prevented this. Did the mayor have something to do with this? Perhaps you&#39;ll never know.]

\The society got together under the library for its weekly tabletop game session. They start to play through their game collection, with the winner of each game getting to choose the next one.

During their game of Uno, they heard some loud noises coming from outside. They were rumbling sounds, accompanied by the ground shaking. &quot;Hmm,&quot; one of the members says, &quot;must be small earthquakes.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re getting kinda annoying,&quot; another member complained, &quot;it&#39;s messing up our card piles.&quot;

Eventually, Jed was able to win the game of Uno. Since that was the last game of the session, everyone packed up and then headed upstairs.]
\(if:$reliveDream is &quot;Construction&quot;)[(set:$continueText to false)
\The end result was a sight to behold, in that it looked absolutely awful. However, it caught one tourist&#39;s eye, who somehow viewed it as a work of art.

&quot;Wow, what an interesting statement on the current state of modern construction! A very interesting piece! And a big one, too! I must tell my friends about this!&quot;

Jed&#39;s &quot;art&quot; became a big tourist attraction. The next day, Jed turned it into a museum of some kind, charging for admission and giving tours around it. After a few days, the mayor reached out to him and bought it for a large amount of money, which Jed accepted.

Webster Groves became a much more lively place. The buzz generated by Jed&#39;s construction caused a lot more visitors to the town. Some people even liked the quaint atmosphere and moved in permanently. The influx of people was also a big help to the local businesses scattered around town, which received more customers daily.

After a couple of days, the sky tu- wait what? The sky is blue like normal... Sorry, it&#39;s just that usually after a certain amount of time of ignoring the story, some catastrophe happens. Strange... Okay, I guess Webster Groves lived happily ever after, or something like that.]

&quot;I&#39;m Nolan,&quot; the tall person says.

&quot;I&#39;m Stan,&quot; the third person says.

&quot;And I&#39;m the leader of the group, Ma-&quot;

&quot;ARRESTED!&quot; you hear a voice yell. You all turn around to see four police officers. You start to run, but the officers quickly catch up, cuff all four of you, and take you to the holding cell.

You know Jed, you could&#39;ve gotten away from this entire scenario if you just listened to me in the hardware store. Why did you feel the need to uphold a promise you made to a criminal gang?

\Jed and Cheri exited the time machine, trying to piece together what they had just seen. They believed that in the future, Webster Groves would be struck by a meteor that would cause some kind of apocolypse. 

They began trying to convice people to move out of Webster Groves before it was too late. To avoid the inevitable meteor strike that they saw with their own eyes! They&#39;ve seen the future!

Of course, they quickly got labelled as conspiracy theorists and lost any reputation they once had. Cheri lost her job. Jed lost his title of eerdowell. From then on it was Jed and Cheri versus the world. The knowledge that Webster Groves as they knew it and there was nothing they could do to convice the others continued to haunt them...]

\Jed sat next to the front door of Bosco&#39;s, wondering what to do now. While Jed does understand that what he did was deserving of a ban, he also felt that he never would have done those things if he didn&#39;t find out what John Bosco truly felt about him. So there he sat next to the door, almost as if he was protesting his ban.

He sat there all day. As the store closed, John walked past him and paid no attention.

He sat there overnight, where the opening manager of the store saw him but also paid no attention (more so because she was confused rather than disliking Jed). He sat there the rest of the day, where John passed him twice: when he came into work and when he closed the store.

This pattern happened for days. Jed simply refused to go to another store for his groceries. He just could never believe what happened between him and John. He thought they were friends; they talked every time he came to the store, John always seemed interested in what he had to say, and always let Jed speak as long as he wanted, with minimal interruption. 

But of course, you can&#39;t sit in one place for long before your basic human needs need to be fulfilled. And since Jed refused to go anywhere else, it was only a matter of time before he died.]
